In the case of spiral galaxies, where the total mass is at the center, the velocity of external objects (like our Sun), was expected to follow the same trend, however it was obsevered that most of the spiral galaxies had rotational velocities of $v \\sim \\rm{cte}$. It can be deducted that there is matter density (a halo) that should follow $\\rho \\propto r^{-2}$ in order to explain the constant velocity.\n",

He also hold unconventional ideas such as an alternative cosmology explaining the red-shift as tired light or believing that we could re-arrange the planets in the solar system using rockets to make them habitable. \"His innovative work in any one of these areas would have brought fame and honors to a scientist with a more conventional personality. But Zwicky was anything but conventional. . . He once said, ‘Astronomers are spherical bastards. No matter how you look at them they are just bastards.’ His colleagues did not appreciate this aggressive attitude and, mainly for that reason, despite Zwicky’s major contributions to astronomy, he remains virtually unknown to the public.\" (From Steven Soter and Neil deGrasse Tyson, Eds., Cosmic Horizons:\n",
